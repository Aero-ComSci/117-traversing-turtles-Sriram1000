# Planning Document.

 - I will need to use classes
 - I will need to use while loops and for loops
 - I will need to use functions
 - I will need to use lists and indexing
 - I will need to make an __init__ function
 - I will need to make a move function
 - I need to make an empty list and add items in there so I can loop it
